Grind the shredded coconut in the macarator. Save 50g for the decoration. Roast the remaining coconut in a pan without fat - the rasps shouldn't gain any colour. Let it cool down.

Mix the shredded coconut with the flour, 90g powdered sugar, vanilla pulp, a pinch salt and butter first with the dough hook and after that with hands to a smooth dough. Form a ball and cool it covered for an hour.

Form it to 35-40 cherry-like balls and put them on a baking plate with baking paper under it. Bake it in for ca. 10 minutes and 160Â°C (recirculating air).

Mix 100g powdered sugar with the shredded coconut from the beginning. Take the cookies out of the oven. Toss them in the powdered sugar-coconut mix or pour the mix over the cookies.
